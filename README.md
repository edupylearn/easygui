SimpleGUI
=======

SimpleGUI is EasyGUI but fixes an error that stops EasyGUI working. It is a module for very simple, very easy GUI programming in Python. SimpleGUI is different from other GUI
libraries in that SimpleGUI is NOT event-driven. Instead, all GUI interactions are invoked by simple function calls.

SimpleGUI runs on Python 2 and 3, and does not have any dependencies beyond python.
